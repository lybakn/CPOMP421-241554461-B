1. Generate a private key:
   Command:
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

2. Generate a public key:
   Command:
   openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key

3. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
   Command:
   openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr
   (You will be prompted to enter the Distinguished Name fields: Country, State, Locality, Organization, Organizati>

4. Create a self-signed certificate:
   Command:
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -signkey private.key -out self_signed_certificate.crt

5. Generate the CA private key:
   Command:
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca_private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

6. Create the self-signed CA certificate:
   Command:
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca_private_key.pem -out ca_certificate.crt
   (You will be prompted to enter the Distinguished Name fields for the CA certificate.)
7. Issue a certificate using the CA:
   Command:
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -CA ca_certificate.crt -CAkey ca_private_key.pem -CAcreateserial -ou>
   (This will use the CA certificate to sign the CSR and generate an issued certificate.)

8. Verify the issued certificate:
   Command:
   openssl verify -CAfile ca_certificate.crt issued_certificate.crt
   (This verifies that the issued certificate is correctly signed by the CA certificate.)
